This is a portfolio of projects I have carried out on my way to my Advanced Computer Science degree.

# Advanced Topics in Software Engineering

I used genetic algorithms to evolve the string "Hello, World!" in [Basic Search Strategies](https://github.com/tiggerdine/basic-search-strategies), solve the test case prioritisation problem in [Regression Testing](https://github.com/tiggerdine/regression-testing) (pair project) and solve the next release problem in [Multi-Objective Optimisation](https://github.com/tiggerdine/multi-objective-optimisation).

I also used genetic programming to build cost prediction models in [Software Cost Estimation](https://github.com/tiggerdine/software-cost-estimation).

# Mobile Software & Applications

I made my first Android app, a pedometer with features like managing a number of goals and keeping a persistent history of daily information, in [Keep Fit](https://github.com/tiggerdine/keep-fit).

In addition, I helped design, implement and test a contextual awareness framework in [Contextual Triggers](https://github.com/tiggerdine/contextual-triggers) (group project).

# Project

The title of my MSc project is "Monopoly with Bitcoin". I am creating a Monopoly clone where the Monopoly money is replaced by my own artificial cryptocurrency and users can explore the concepts of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. See [Monopoly](https://github.com/tiggerdine/monopoly).

In the future, users will be able to find out more about how blockchain works (e.g. through a visualisation) and view blocks.

# Machine Learning for Data Analysis

I predicted the prices of Airbnb properties in [Machine Learning](https://github.com/tiggerdine/machine-learning) and classified handwritten digits and IMDb reviews in [Deep Learning](https://github.com/tiggerdine/deep-learning) (group project).
