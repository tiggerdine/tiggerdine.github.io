This is a portfolio of projects I have carried out on my way to my Advanced Computer Science degree.

# Advanced Topics in Software Engineering

I used genetic algorithms to evolve the string "Hello, World!" in [Basic Search Strategies](https://github.com/tiggerdine/basic-search-strategies), solve the test case prioritisation problem in [Regression Testing](https://github.com/tiggerdine/regression-testing) (pair project) and solve the next release problem in [Multi-Objective Optimisation](https://github.com/tiggerdine/multi-objective-optimisation).

I also used genetic programming to build cost prediction models in [Software Cost Estimation](https://github.com/tiggerdine/software-cost-estimation).

# Mobile Software & Applications

I made my first Android app, a pedometer with features like managing a number of goals and keeping a persistent history of daily information, in [Keep Fit](https://github.com/tiggerdine/keep-fit).

In addition, I helped design, implement and test a contextual awareness framework in [Contextual Triggers](https://github.com/tiggerdine/contextual-triggers) (group project).
